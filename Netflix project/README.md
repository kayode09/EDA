# _Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix Movies Dataset using Python._

### **Objective/purpose**: In this project I explored and performed EDA using the Netflix movies dataset with the objective of analyzing the trends of **average movie durations over time** to provide answers to many questions, such as:

-  What does this trend look like over a longer period of time?
- Is this trend explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? 
- e.t.c
